IMDB Sentiment Analysis with Keras Neural Nets (Experiments)

Extended Francois Chollet's Keras IMDB movie review classification example (50k reviews, binary sentiment). Built baseline model with embedding, flattening, dense layers (ReLU, sigmoid), achieving ~88% validation accuracy. Conducted experiments: (1) Varied hidden layers (1/3); (2) Adjusted units (32/64); (3) Switched loss to MSE; (4) Used tanh activation. Evaluated via validation/test accuracy plots, interpreting impacts (e.g., more layers improved generalization but risked overfitting). Submitted executed Jupyter notebook with code, comments, and result interpretations. AI certificate coursework.
